### Part 1a: The Structure of XTXT

The **Extended Text Format (XTXT)** introduces structural markers to organize text into **frames**, **streams**, and optionally **chunks**. This section explains XTXT’s structure in detail, with extensive examples and a Python-based approach for parsing and interacting with XTXT files.

#### 1.1 Core Concepts

1. **Streams:**
   - A stream is a sequence of related data, such as plain text, styling metadata, or links. 
   - Each stream begins with a **Next Stream Marker (NSM)** (`\xFF\xFE`) and ends at the next marker (`NSM` or `NFM`).

2. **Frames:**
   - Frames group multiple streams into a logical unit. For example, a frame might contain a main text stream and related metadata streams.
   - Frames are separated by a **Next Frame Marker (NFM)** (`\xFF\xFD`).

3. **Chunks (Optional):**
   - Chunks aggregate frames and are separated by a **Next Chunk Marker (NCM)** (`\xFF\xFC`), enabling higher-level grouping.

4. **UTF-8 Compatibility:**
   - XTXT is compatible with UTF-8, ensuring it can be processed as plain text by tools that ignore its multiplexing features.

#### 1.2 Encoding Rules

XTXT encoding relies on well-defined markers:
- **NSM (`\xFF\xFE`)**: Marks the start of a new stream within a frame.
- **NFM (`\xFF\xFD`)**: Marks the end of a frame.
- **NCM (`\xFF\xFC`)**: Marks the end of a chunk (optional).

**Stream Rules:**
- Streams must contain UTF-8 data. Binary data can be base64-encoded if necessary.
- A stream ends at the next `NSM` or `NFM`.

**Frame Rules:**
- Frames may contain any number of streams. At least one stream (`:text`) is expected in most cases.
- A frame ends at the next `NFM`.

**File Rules:**
- The file starts with the first frame and ends after the last frame or chunk marker.

#### 1.3 Examples

**Example 1: Basic XTXT File**

This XTXT file contains two frames. Each frame has a `:text` stream for content and a `:metadata` stream for additional context.

```
Frame 1:
:text
Hello, world!
:metadata
author: Jane Doe
timestamp: 2025-01-06T10:00:00Z

Frame 2:
:text
Goodbye, world!
:metadata
author: Jane Doe
timestamp: 2025-01-06T12:00:00Z
```

**Raw XTXT Encoding:**
```
Hello, world!\xFF\xFEauthor: Jane Doe\n
timestamp: 2025-01-06T10:00:00Z\xFF\xFD
Goodbye, world!\xFF\xFEauthor: Jane Doe\n
timestamp: 2025-01-06T12:00:00Z\xFF\xFD
```

#### 1.4 Parsing XTXT Files in Python

Here’s a Python implementation of a basic XTXT parser using a state machine.

```python
class XTXTParser:
    NSM = b"\xFF\xFE"  # Next Stream Marker
    NFM = b"\xFF\xFD"  # Next Frame Marker
    NCM = b"\xFF\xFC"  # Next Chunk Marker

    def __init__(self, content):
        """Initialize the parser with the raw content."""
        self.content = content
        self.frames = []

    def parse(self):
        """Parse the XTXT content into frames and streams."""
        current_frame = []
        current_stream = []
        lines = self.content.splitlines()

        for line in lines:
            if self.NFM in line:  # End of frame
                if current_stream:
                    current_frame.append(b"".join(current_stream).decode("utf-8"))
                self.frames.append(current_frame)
                current_frame = []
                current_stream = []
            elif self.NSM in line:  # New stream
                if current_stream:
                    current_frame.append(b"".join(current_stream).decode("utf-8"))
                current_stream = []
            else:  # Regular content
                current_stream.append(line)

        # Handle the last frame
        if current_stream:
            current_frame.append(b"".join(current_stream).decode("utf-8"))
        if current_frame:
            self.frames.append(current_frame)

    def get_frames(self):
        """Return the parsed frames."""
        return self.frames
```

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Sample XTXT content
xtxt_content = b"""
Hello, world!\xFF\xFEauthor: Jane Doe\n
timestamp: 2025-01-06T10:00:00Z\xFF\xFD
Goodbye, world!\xFF\xFEauthor: Jane Doe\n
timestamp: 2025-01-06T12:00:00Z\xFF\xFD
"""

# Parse the file
parser = XTXTParser(xtxt_content)
parser.parse()

# Display parsed frames
for frame_idx, frame in enumerate(parser.get_frames()):
    print(f"Frame {frame_idx + 1}:")
    for stream in frame:
        print(f"  {stream}")
```

**Output:**
```
Frame 1:
  Hello, world!
  author: Jane Doe
  timestamp: 2025-01-06T10:00:00Z
Frame 2:
  Goodbye, world!
  author: Jane Doe
  timestamp: 2025-01-06T12:00:00Z
```

#### 1.5 Advanced Parsing Features

1. **Marker Indexing:**
   - Index markers (`NSM`, `NFM`, `NCM`) during an initial scan for random access or efficient navigation.

2. **Stream-Specific Parsers:**
   - Extend the parser to process specific streams differently, such as decoding base64 binary streams or parsing JSON metadata.

**Example for Stream-Specific Handling:**
```python
def parse_metadata(metadata_stream):
    lines = metadata_stream.splitlines()
    return {line.split(": ")[0]: line.split(": ")[1] for line in lines}

metadata = parse_metadata("author: Jane Doe\ntimestamp: 2025-01-06T10:00:00Z")
print(metadata)  # {'author': 'Jane Doe', 'timestamp': '2025-01-06T10:00:00Z'}
```

#### 1.6 Benefits of XTXT Structure

1. **Simplicity:**
   - Uses minimal markers to separate streams and frames, making it easy to parse.

2. **Modularity:**
   - Streams are logically isolated, allowing independent processing.

3. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - Non-XTXT-aware tools can process the primary stream as plain text.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Enables partial loading or parallel processing of frames and streams.
