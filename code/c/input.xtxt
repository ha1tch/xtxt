ÿşÿşÿıOr, a vision in a dream. A Fragment.

ÿşÿşÿı
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıIn Xanadu did Kubla Khan
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıA stately pleasure-dome decree:
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıWhere Alph, the sacred river, ran
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıThrough caverns measureless to man
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıDown to a sunless sea.
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıSo twice five miles of fertile ground
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıWith walls and towers were girdled round;
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAnd there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıWhere blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAnd here were forests ancient as the hills,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıEnfolding sunny spots of greenery.
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıBut oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıDown the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıA savage place! as holy and enchanted
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAs eâ€™er beneath a waning moon was haunted
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıBy woman wailing for her demon-lover!
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAnd from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAs if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıA mighty fountain momently was forced:
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAmid whose swift half-intermitted burst
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıHuge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıOr chaffy grain beneath the thresherâ€™s flail:
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAnd mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıIt flung up momently the sacred river.
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıFive miles meandering with a mazy motion
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıThrough wood and dale the sacred river ran,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıThen reached the caverns measureless to man,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAnd sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAnd â€™mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAncestral voices prophesying war!
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıThe shadow of the dome of pleasure
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıFloated midway on the waves;
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıWhere was heard the mingled measure
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıFrom the fountain and the caves.
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıIt was a miracle of rare device,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıA sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıA damsel with a dulcimer
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıIn a vision once I saw:
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıIt was an Abyssinian maid
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAnd on her dulcimer she played,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıSinging of Mount Abora.
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıCould I revive within me
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıHer symphony and song,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıTo such a deep delight â€™twould win me,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıThat with music loud and long,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıI would build that dome in air,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıThat sunny dome! those caves of ice!
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAnd all who heard should see them there,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAnd all should cry, Beware! Beware!
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıHis flashing eyes, his floating hair!
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıWeave a circle round him thrice,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAnd close your eyes with holy dread
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıFor he on honey-dew hath fed,
ÿşÿş
ÿşÿşÿıAnd drunk the milk of Paradise.
